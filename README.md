Discord bot build from following mainly [this guide](https://refruity.xyz/writing-discord-bot/) and a bit of 
[this codebase](https://github.com/dtinth/discord-transcriber).

Built with

- node v10.16.0
- discord.js v12.0.0-dev

## Future Plans
- Add permissions for who can / can't use the voice recognition features. It can get pretty costly.
- Add features all the other bots have out there (e.g. kicking, playing music, etc)
- Add those same features, but make it voice enabled.
